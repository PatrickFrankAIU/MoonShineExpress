### Project Details
MoonShineExpress is a jewelry e-commerce web application built with a focus on modern web development practices. The application demonstrates a complete shopping experience with product browsing, cart management, checkout, and order tracking functionality.

#### How It Works
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js provides RESTful API endpoints for products and orders
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and client-side rendering
- **Data Storage**: JSON file-based persistence for products and orders
- **State Management**: Client-side state management using sessionStorage for cart data
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with dark/light mode toggle

#### Key Features
- Product catalog with images and descriptions
- Shopping cart with quantity controls
- Tax calculation and order summary
- Checkout process with customer information collection
- Order confirmation and tracking system
- Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence

#### Technology Stack
- **Server**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for product and order data
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code

The application demonstrates RESTful API design principles and full-stack JavaScript development practices in a project focused on e-commerce functionality.

#### Steps to Complete
1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install Node.js and npm if not already installed
   - Clone this repository to your local machine
   - Run `npm install` to install required dependencies

2. **Understand the Codebase**
   - Review the server.js file to understand the existing API endpoints
   - Examine the main.js file to understand frontend functionality
   - Explore the data structure in the products.json and orders.json files

3. **Run the Application**
   - Start the server with `npm start` or `node server.js`
   - Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

4. **Opportunities for Improvement**
   - Implement product search functionality with real-time filtering
   - Add search categories with buttons
   - Create an admin dashboard for order management
   - Add user authentication functionality
   - Upgrade dark mode functionality to be user-specific

5. **Testing**
   - Test all user workflows (browsing, adding to cart, checkout)
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Verify responsive design works on different screen sizes
   - Test dark mode functionality

6. **Documentation and Submission**
   - Document any changes or additions you've made
   - Create a detailed explanation of your implementation
   - Deploy your completed application to Render.com
   - Submit your work through the specified channels for grading
